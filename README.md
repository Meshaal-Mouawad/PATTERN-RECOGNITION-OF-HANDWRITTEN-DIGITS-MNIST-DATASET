# Abstractâ€”. 
MNIST, Modified National Institute of Standards and Technology, is the largest database of handwritten numbers used in deep learning, and machine learning. In this project, a hands-on experience of applying machine learning and pattern recognition techniques is given to a real-world data set such as MNIST. Multiple building blocks have been proposed and analyzed to improve the speed and the accuracy of the Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN). Two networks have been used with the same data. In network I, a three-layer MLP with ReLU and dropout resulting in fast training process with over all accuracy 95% during training and 94% for testing. Network II on the other hand, a stack of CNN, RelU, and Max pooling shows slower training process with better accuracy than network I and overall, 99% accuracy for training, and 98.9% for testing. Another modification on network II improved overall accuracy during the training to 99.82% and accuracy for testing to 99.25%. this modification will be shown in the report. The building blocks for the project will be discussed briefly with the results and figures. Python code is also provided for this project. This project may be used for as a guidance for new students or engineers who aiming to understand pattern recognition.
